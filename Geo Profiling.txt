1: Travel safety has always been a matter of great concern in India. 
2: Travelers have been using applications like Google Maps on a large scale. 
3: Often these passengers unknowingly select routes which pose potential threats to their security. 
4: The current routing options offered by services like Google Maps do not consider various security parameters. 
5: “Travel Safe (TS)” is an AI-enabled mobile application which aims to make road travel safer than ever. 
6: TS will give the highest priority to the travelers’ safety by classifying routes into several categories like Safe, Moderately Unsafe, Extremely Unsafe, etc. 
7: This application will introduce “Safety Scale” for precise and detailed classification of routes. 
8: Every region will be assigned a safety rating which will be then mapped onto the “Safety Scale”. 
9: The safety ratings for every region will be generated by an ML (Machine Learning)-based prediction model. 
10: Once all the feasible routes are identified, the most secure route will be found by using the safety rating and will be recommended to the users. 
11: If a user selects a potentially unsafe route by going against the recommendations, the emergency contacts will be notified about the same as a measure of security.
